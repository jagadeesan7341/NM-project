# 🔍 AI-Based Quality Control in Manufacturing

This project implements an AI-driven quality control system using image classification to detect surface defects in manufactured steel using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It uses the publicly available NEU Surface Defect Database.

---

## 📦 Dataset

**NEU Surface Defect Database**:  
Contains 6 types of steel surface defects with 300 grayscale images each (200x200 px).

- Crazing
- Inclusion
- Patches
- Pitted Surface
- Rolled-in Scale
- Scratches

---

## 🚀 Features

- Image classification using CNN
- Surface defect prediction
- Model accuracy up to 90%
- Clean dataset pre-processing pipeline
- Visualization of training progress (accuracy and loss)

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling
- Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling
- Flatten → Dense → Softmax

Trained using `categorical_crossentropy` loss and `Adam` optimizer.

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-quality-control.git
cd ai-quality-control
````

2. Install dependencies:
